-- Primary key column:
-- Use the name id and then SERIAL PRIMARY KEY.
-- Foreign key columns:
-- Add _id to the singular name of the column you are referencing.
-- If the primary key is SERIAL, then the foreign key should be INTEGER.
-- You also should create the foreign key with REFERENCES table_name(id) ON DELETE CASCADE.
-- Names, emails, usernames and passwords can all be stored as VARCHAR(255). Students to cohorts would be cohort_id. The type would be INTEGER .
-- Dates would use the DATE type. If we needed date and time, use TIMESTAMP.
-- Numbers:
-- We will use INTEGER to represent most numbers. There are other sizes of integers as well.
-- SMALLINT -32,768 to 32,767 (thirty-two thousand)
-- INTEGER -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (two billion)
-- BIGINT -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (nine quintillion)
-- SERIAL 1 to 2,147,483,647 (auto incrementing)
-- Dates, Phone Numbers & Currency
-- Become familiar with the ISO 8601 date formatting standard. The string '2018-02-12' uses this format to represent 'February 12th, 2018'. Year, month and then day. Dates should be stored consistently. Apply timezones and formatting when displayed to the user.
-- Store phone numbers as VARCHAR, there are so many possible formats. The number 214 748 3647 hits our INTEGER limit.
-- Store currency as an integer representing cents. Use a BIGINT if you need values over $21 million dollars.





SELECT students.name as student_name, email, cohorts.name as cohort_name

-- aka INNER JOIN - only students who have a cohort_id and cohorts with students

SELECT students.name as student_name, email, cohorts.name as cohort_name
FROM students LEFT OUTER JOIN cohorts ON cohorts.id = cohort_id;

-- if a query returns a single value, we can use it inside a select statement

SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT something_id
  FROM someTable
  WHERE something
) as sub_table;
-- the result of a select is p.much a table and can also be used as a data source of another select

SELECT avg(total_students) as average_students
FROM (
  SELECT count(students) as total_students
  FROM students
  JOIN cohorts on cohorts.id = cohort_id
  GROUP BY cohorts

-- we can also use a table inside a from statement!

SELECT avg(total_students) as average_students
FROM (
  SELECT count(students) as total_students, cohorts.name as cohort_name
  FROM students
  JOIN cohorts on cohorts.id = cohort_id
  GROUP BY cohorts.name
) as totals_table;
-- and this works inside a table with multiple columns!

-- A sub query's results can also be used within the WHERE clause
-- of a query. This is perhaps the most common way of using a sub select:

SELECT assignments.name
FROM assignments 
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT assignment_id
  FROM assignment_submissions
  JOIN students ON students.id = student_id
  WHERE students.name = 'Ibrahim Schimmel'
);

SELECT * FROM table
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT something_id
  FROM someTable
  WHERE something
);
-- Here's a generic version.
